# Meme generator

Based off the material presented by Bob Ziroll in his 2022 Tutorial for React JavaScript Library.

I made minor additional changes:
- use SCSS and made personal style decisions
- adapt markup

Preview is available on [this repo's github page](https://mduboule.github.io/react-meme-generator/). Fun.
